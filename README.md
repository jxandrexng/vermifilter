# Automated Vermifiltration System
Automated Vermifiltration System by EJ Mindanao | Jerome Ng | Marx Sabandana

This is an undergraduate thesis done under the advisory of Engr. Jerwin V. Obmerga in Southern Luzon State University (Lucban, Philippines)

The gist of the codes within this repository are mostly for water quality testing and monitoring, such as:
pH Levels, Turbidity levels, water levels

and automation of functions such as water pumping, and dilution.

A significant part of the code is in Python and most of it is for the GUI.
